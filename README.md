Since i've not found online a complete and simple guide or tutorial for msgraph apis
i decided to put here a simple collection of methods for basics things on Sharepoint

These methods cover:
- Authentication ( done automatically with a producer, given the right credentials in application.properties)
- Upload
- Download
- Folder creation
- Public and private link creation for folders and files
